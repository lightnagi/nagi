/**
 * In LLP world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's
 * attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time 
 * that Ashe is in poisoned condition.
 * You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition
 * immediately.
 * 求Ashe被Teemo攻击所致的中毒时间。
 * 
 * 思路：遍历数组，把相邻两个元素差值和中毒时间作比较，取二者较小值算入中毒时间总和。
